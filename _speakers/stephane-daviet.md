Born in 1980, lead dev at MAIF.

Versed mainly in Java and JavaScript with a good knowledge of Spring and React, but eagerly looking to other techs like Scala, Kotlin or Python. I like all what relates to coding but also to meta-coding, like thinking to why & how we should embrace technology both for ourselves or for others.
