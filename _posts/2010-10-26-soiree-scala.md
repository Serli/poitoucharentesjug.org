The topic of this presentation is about using Scala programming language with GridGain framework to provide a simple and productive cloud computing platform.

Scala is a hybrid function and object-oriented language that is rapidly gaining traction in becoming the “next” Java in JVM-based language evolution. GridGain is one of the most rapidly growing cloud development platforms for JVM-based languages.

2/3 of the presentation will be devoted to live coding demonstration of writing basic MapReduce application in Scala using GridGain middleware. All coding during demonstration will be done live. Overview of grid and cloud computing concepts as well as notion of Native Cloud Applications will be discussed. Short intro into Scala language will also be provided.

***What problems/challenges will an attendee learn to solve by attending your session?***

Attendee will learn how to use Scala - one of the most exciting JVM-based languages - to quickly and efficiently build cloud-enabled applications. They will also learn on how to quickly build simple MapReduce application using GridGain framework.

***What will attendees learn by attending your session?***
