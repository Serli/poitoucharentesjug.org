Where are my Servlets and XML files? Play - a mindset shift in Java web development

The Play! framework is more than just yet another web framework in the Java eco-system: it is also another way of developing web applications. Like RoR, Django, it encourages fast and expressive development, with a clean and pragmatic API. Most importantly, perhaps, it brings simplicity to the Java world.

Because it is a simple, stateless framework that promotes a RESTful approach it offers the possibility of building complex web applications and, by extension, complex systems.
